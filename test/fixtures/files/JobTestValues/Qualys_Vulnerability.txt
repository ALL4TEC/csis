  title: Open RPC Services List
  category: RPC
  patchable: '0'
  diagnosis: A port scanner was used to draw a map of all the RPC services that are
    accessible.<P>
  consequence: Unauthorized users can subsequently test vulnerabilities related to
    each of the services open.<P>
  solution: Shut down any unknown or unused service on the list. To remove all RPC
    services, you cannot simply filter port 111 at the firewall because port 111 (the
    &quot;portmap&quot; service) only shows which ports the RPC services are listening
    on. Therefore, it cannot block access to these services. Disable the RPC services
    at the server level because each listens on an ephemeral UDP or TCP port.<P>

  qid: '11'
  vuln_type: Vulnerability
  severity: '2'
  title: Hidden RPC Services
  category: RPC
  patchable: '0'
  diagnosis: "The Portmapper/Rpcbind listens on port 111 and stores an updated list
    of registered RPC services running on the server (RPC name, version and port number).
    It acts as a \"gateway\" for clients wanting to connect to any RPC daemon. \n<P>\nWhen
    the portmapper/rpcbind is removed or firewalled, standard RPC client programs
    fail to obtain the portmapper list.  However, by sending carefully crafted packets,
    it's possible to determine which RPC programs are listening on which port. This
    technique is known as direct RPC scanning. It's used to bypass portmapper/rpcbind
    in order to find RPC programs running on a port (TCP or UDP ports). On Linux servers,
    RPC services are typically listening on privileged ports (below 1024), whereas
    on Solaris, RPC services are on temporary ports (starting with port 32700)."
  consequence: "Unauthorized users can build a list of RPC services running on the
    host. If they discover vulnerable RPC services on the host, they then can exploit
    them.\n\n"
  solution: "Firewalling the portmapper port or removing the portmapper service is
    not sufficient to prevent unauthorized users from accessing the RPC daemons. You
    should remove all RPC services that are not strictly required on this host. \n\n"
